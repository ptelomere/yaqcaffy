-TODO------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- add possibility to set groups for qc analysis
- add more stats than correlation values (for example % genes with 
  FC<0.5, FC>2...) in reprodPlot
- add an 'Affymetrix Report File input' argument to yaqc
- check that morespikes and alpha/qc.probes have the same chips
(- more report-like reprodPlot graph)
- add a parameter 'list of .CEL files' to be removed/(re)included
- everything works well with current version of simpleaffy (2.10.3),
  put on Windows (simpleaffy version 2.10.11), an error about error
  "data set 'moresipkes' not found in: data(morespikes, envir=.yaqcEnv)"
  appears; will probably appear once newer version is commited for 
  linux (src package)

13sep07 new svn repositary
13sep07 modifications after Marc Carlon's inital review
06jun07 changed reprodPlot output from pdf to png format in the 
        vignette because de space requirements.
15mai07 checked building checking for time requirements: to get 
        openVignette() working, the vignette is now included (not only
        the pdf file) put the reprodPlot.pdf figure is added as an 
        additional file (reprodPlot() is not evaluated by Sweave),
        which brings the build/check process below 5 minutes.
        But the size is now of 3.7M for the package and 8.7 for the 
        source directory.
15mai07 updated vignette
15mai07 fixed QC ratio for logged input
14mai07 fixed getOutliers() for YAQStats built from ExpressionSet
14mai07 renamed getExtremes() in getOutliers()
14mai07 fixing documentation
11mai07 added fc diagonals on the reproducibility scatter plots
10mai07 added CV calculation for qc metrics
10mai07 moved refX.RData and related documentation to MAQCsubsetAFX
        ExperimentData package
23apr07 added getExtremes function
22apr07 imporved reprodPlot: sample names appear on the diagonal,
        axis are present, removed lost space between plots
21apr07 now qc plots work whether an AffyBactch or ExpressionSet
        are given as input
21apr07 combined yaqcplot1,2,3 into one graph
21apr07 possible to use exprSet object instead of AffyBatch objects 
        to use justRMA for preprocessing of bigger datasets 
21apr07 added a logged parameter when providing exprSet
21apr07 added sample names on the diagonal in repordplot()
21apr07 changed geneNames() which is depracated with featureNames
        in reprod.R
21apr07 fixed reference description in vignette and documentation
20apr07 update ref(A|B|C|D)
19apr07 Namespace issues fixed with help of Seth Falcon and addition
	of a NAMESPACE file into simpleaffy.
12apr07 use smoothscatter for reprodPlot
11apr07 Start to use local subversion to track changes
11mar07 ERROR: Error in apply(MAQCStatsObject@bio.calls,2,function(x)...
        Cannot get a slot ("bio.calls") from an object of type closure
        Observed when calling maqc.plot(q,2): FIXED
09mar07 print outliers an maqc.plot(d,1) graphs
09mar07 check that different tgt can be given as input
